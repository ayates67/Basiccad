## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
Today I used my knowledge to create a mount in onshape. It was fairly easy because all I had to do was make a square and cut 5 holes in it.

### Reflection
This was an easy assignment. Today I remembered how to cut holes in objects. I took me some time, but after playing around with onshape for a while, I finally got it to work.

## Fork

### Description
I created a fork to hold a wheel. It is an extruded circle with two holders. Each of the holders has a hole that hold the wheel. The back of the big cylinder had a tube sticking out that in 60mm tall.

### Reflection
This assignment was difficult but I learned how to extrude and fillet the object. I also learned how to concentric two circles.

## Tire

### Description
This assignment was to create a wheel. The wheel had 5 holes with 1mm filets inside of it.

### Image

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned how to make circles extrude and then fillet so that they are round on the outside. I also learned how to make a hole in a bigger extrson and that you can extrude some parts of a part without extruding the whole thing.

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned how to use the fillet feature to fillet multiple things at a time. I also mastered using the symetry feature by making an extrusion symetric.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
In this assignment I made a bearing on the wheel, a big bearing, and an axle with a collar attached to in.
### Evidence

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned how to make a flat in an axle. I also learned how to create two different parts in the same document. I also learned ho to name parts in the document. This assignment really help me learn the final building feature that I need to know and I am ready to start my assembly now.

## SubAssembly

### Description
In this assignment I assembled the parts to the wheel. The wheel  has the tire, axle, collar, and bearings.

### Image

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned how to assemble the parts. I learned the basic mates and how much easier onshape is than solidworks in my opinion. This assignment took me a little while because at first my axle was a little messed up and so was my mate between the bearing and wheel. I figure it out by percervering and going through all of the possibilities.

## FinalAssembly

### Description
In this assignment I finished the caster and assembled everything. I used mostly revolute mates and a few parrelel mates. Every single part that I have made was in this assembly.

### Reflection
In this assignment I finally finished the final assembly for the caster. This was by far the hardest assignment in my opinion. I had a messed up fork in the begining so I had to spend 3 days fixing the legs of it. Then I couldn't figure out how to put the pins in so that took me awhile. After days of hard work I got everything to work. This was a big relief to me since it had taken me so long and I had run into so many obstacles but I finally finished.

## CollabChallange

### Description
In this project we built 7 parts to make an assembly in onshape.

### Reflection
In this assignment I worked through challenges and worked together with my partners to build 7 parts that fit together. This was a big acomplishment. We ran into some challenges like figuiring out the lengths and widths of the parts but ultimatly got the job done.
